pyORM
=====

Now with fancy features!

Take a look at: https://github.com/daringer/pyORM/blob/master/example.py

data-structure (of arbitrary depth and complexity) into a relational database. 
- Totally transparent through your _NOT_ specifically tailored class!
- Absolute unintrusive! Not a single line has to be changed inside the class to
  be load and saved from the database. (currently only sqlite is supported)

But still in alpha stage, but we're getting there! Meanwhile, the following holds:

Very slim, early stage, Python Object-Relational-Mapper - Targeting for extremely fast understanding, usability and simplicity!
